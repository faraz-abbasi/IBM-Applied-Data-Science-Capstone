# 🚀 SpaceX Falcon-9 Landing Success Prediction
Predict whether the **SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully** after launch.

SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 launches at **$62M**, while competitors charge over **$165M**.  
This price difference is largely due to **SpaceX’s ability to reuse the first stage**.  
Therefore, predicting whether the booster will land allows us to estimate launch costs—valuable information for organizations competing against SpaceX.

# 📂 Project Overview

This capstone project uses **data science methodologies**, **web scraping**, **REST APIs**, **interactive dashboards**, and **machine learning** to build a predictive model determining first-stage landing success.

The project is divided into four major parts:

---

## 1️⃣ Data Collection, Web Scraping & Data Wrangling

### **Objectives**
- Write Python code to manipulate data using **Pandas**.
- Convert JSON data into a **Pandas DataFrame**.
- Create and share Jupyter notebooks using GitHub.
- Define and formulate a real-world business problem using data science methodology.
- Load, clean, and explore datasets to extract meaningful insights.
- Collect launch data via:
  - **SpaceX REST API**
  - **Web scraping** (Wikipedia Falcon 9 record)

---

## 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### **Objectives**
- Use REST API and web scraping to collect and prepare data.
- Convert all collected data into a unified DataFrame.
- Perform data wrangling to address missing values and inconsistencies.
- Create:
  - **Scatter plots**
  - **Bar charts**
  - **Correlation visualizations**
- Execute **SQL queries** to analyze launch records.
- Use visualizations to uncover meaningful patterns for model development.

## 3️⃣ Interactive Visual Analytics & Dashboards

Built using:
- **Plotly Dash** (interactive dashboard)
- **Folium** (interactive geospatial maps)

### **Objectives**
- Build a dashboard with:
  - **Pie charts** (mission outcomes)
  - **Scatter plots** (payload vs. success)
  - **Dynamic filters** (dropdowns, sliders)
- Use Folium to:
  - Plot launch site coordinates
  - Calculate distances
  - Mark clusters
  - Visualize success/failure distribution on the map
- Create tools to interactively analyze launch records.

---

## 4️⃣ Predictive Analysis (Classification Models)

Using machine learning to predict Falcon 9 landing success.

### **Objectives**
- Split the dataset into **training** and **testing** sets.
- Train multiple classification algorithms:
  - **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
  - **Decision Trees**
  - **Logistic Regression**
- Perform **hyperparameter tuning** using GridSearchCV.
- Select the best model based on test accuracy.
- Use the predictive model to support real-world business decision-making.
